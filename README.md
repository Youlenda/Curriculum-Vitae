I have finished my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering at [the University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) and graduated with my B.Sc. degree in Control Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en). I have written a research paper, results from my master's thesis, titled [Control of computer pointer using hand gesture recognition in motion pictures](https://github.com/Youlenda/Mouse-using-hand-gesture-recognition-). It controlled the computer's cursor with hand gesture recognition in front of a camera using computer vision methods. My Bachelor's research experience was [machine learning classification methods on EEG signals extracted from human brain activity in order to classify drivers conciseness](https://github.com/Youlenda/Driver-s-consciousness-level-analysis-using-EEG-signals). 


My research interests are listed below:

* Deep Learning
* Neural Networks
* Object Detection and Recognition
* Hand Gesture Recognition
* Computer Vision
* Human-Computer Interaction
* Machine Learning
* Signal Processing
