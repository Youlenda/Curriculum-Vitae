# Curriculum-Vitae

I have finished my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering at [the University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) and graduated with my B.Sc. degree in Control Engineering from [the Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en). I have written a research paper, results from my master's thesis, titled [Control of computer pointer using hand gesture recognition in motion pictures](https://github.com/Youlenda/Mouse-using-hand-gesture-recognition-). It controlled the computer's cursor with hand gesture recognition in front of a camera using computer vision methods. My Bachelor's research experience was [machine learning classification methods on EEG signals extracted from human brain activity in order to classify drivers conciseness](https://github.com/Youlenda/Driver-s-consciousness-level-analysis-using-EEG-signals).

I have written a research paper, results from my master's thesis, titled [control of computer pointer using hand gesture recognition in motion pictures](https://github.com/Youlenda/Mouse-using-hand-gesture-recognition-), which controlled the computer's pointer with hand gesture recognition in front of a camera using CNNs. My bachelor's research experience is [machine learning classification methods on EEG signals extracted from human brain activity in order to classify drivers' conciseness](https://github.com/Youlenda/Driver-s-consciousness-level-analysis-using-EEG-signals). I also have advanced knowledge in python programming as well as TensorFlow and Keras framework.
